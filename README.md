For our final project at Lighthouse Labs, my partners and I teamed up to make a carpool app.

We wanted to continue learning and challenging ourselves, and so decided on a Postgres database with a Rails API for our back end. On the front, we broke out of the school curriculum and built a React app running on a Node server. We learned about components, ES6, and took on Material-UI for styling.

My main focus was implementing the map and filtering search results.
